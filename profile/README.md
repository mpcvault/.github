Built on advanced multiparty computation technologies, MPCVault sets itself apart from other custodians and wallet providers due to its distinctive, patent-pending technologies. The platform operates in a multi-cloud environment, making use of both Intel SGX and AMD's SEV for TEE runtime. This orthogonal platform significantly reduces the risk of compromise. In addition, MPCVault ensures superior security by enabling end-to-end encrypted communication as default with public key pinning, establishing a zero-trust architecture.
